# Monty Hall Problem

## Description

### Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show "Let's Make a Deal" and named after its original host, Monty Hall.

Wikipedia explains the problem in more details here:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

### This Application

I created this application to demonstrate, by brute force, that the probabilities calculated by Wikipedia are correct.

If you are interested about how I did it, check out the sources and/or read the article: [doc/article](doc/article/README.md)
